# Simple React App with Riot Games API Integration

This is a simple React app that pulls data from the Riot Games API to display players' names and levels. The app also features two buttons that are better left unclicked for your own good.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm must be installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Features

- Displays players' names and levels retrieved from the Riot Games API.
- Two tempting buttons that are better left unclicked.

## Important Notice

Please refrain from clicking the tempting buttons, as they might have unintended consequences on you.
(Hints: Decades old...)

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to submit a pull request.

## Future Additions
I want to in the future add Summoner's Icon, WR, Total Games played, Match History, Current Free Rotation of champions, and some stupid goofy thing of the player's most played champion.(Probably insulting, honestly doesn't even matter its a LoL application, you experience worse playing the game.)
